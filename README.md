## Deep Multiple Instance Learning

This repository contains a TensorFlow implementation of the CNN-MIL
combination described in [Classifying and Segmenting Microscopy Images with
Deep Multiple Instance Learning](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4908336/pdf/btw252.pdf) from Brendan Frey's lab.
The unique contribution of this paper is the noisyAND module.
The implemented model uses the MNIST dataset for classification.

### Dependencies
